A mysterious disease that seems to have been afflicting the leviathans of Eilnaat.

- This disease has weakened many, but none were known to die from it until recently. One disease symptom includes the secretion of a yellow, sticky substance.

It seems to be affecting the Leviathans at different rates
- [[Leviathan of Amakaru]] - Dead
- [[Seraphims]] - One seems to be in the late stages of infection. The others do not show signs
- [[The Volcano, Magnibora|Magnibora]] & [[The Caretaker, Hami'Toa|Hami'Toa]] - Show no signs of infection. Magnibora should be looked after after eating the flesh of the dead leviathan
- [[Plaguebringer|The Plaguebringer]] - Unsure, but he did eat the flesh of the dead leviathan
