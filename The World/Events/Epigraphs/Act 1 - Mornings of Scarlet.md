"I will always enjoy the stories of what the islands have become. I think they deserve to be remembered."

"I have learned many stories on my travels, but they all end the same way. It can be a bit boring sometimes. Let me think of one…"

###  The Beggar

"There was once a Beggar who lay sick with nobody to mourn him and but a single possession to his name. But he could not die yet, for he wanted nothing more than to become king someday."

"The sickly Beggar struggled to stand, yet he walked towards the--well, let's call it a palace--nonetheless. None stopped the Beggar, for he was just that. Nothing special, nothing new."

"The Beggar arrived at his destination. He begged to see the King to any who would listen. Those who heard the Beggar laughed, but something about his intensity had them grant his request. The Beggar said that he wished to become king himself before he died. The King took pity and knelt by the Beggar and spoke to him. The Beggar did not like his response."

"Before any could react, the Beggar took out his final possession and plunged it into each of the King's hearts. The Beggar smiled and took the King's crown off of his lifeless head. The guards raised their weapons and attacked. However, for a few fleeting moments, the Beggar was King."

"I have many more stories I could recite… Maybe later I shall think of another. There is a long way to go still, after all."

"I suppose I am just trying to find ways to distract myself now. Despite all the people I've seen, the journey has been a little lonely without anyone to talk to. I suppose what I'm trying to say is… I miss you, Dad."

"Those days on our little island seem so far away… I miss it. I am sorry."

"While I admit that was foolish and naïve, I hated you, Father. Well I suppose I still do, in a way."

"Those were many long and lonely nights I spent on our island. While you… I still don't quite know what you were doing all that time away."
