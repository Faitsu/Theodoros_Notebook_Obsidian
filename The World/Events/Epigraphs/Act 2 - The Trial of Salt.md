"Oh! I felt it. A Warden calling out for but a moment, like a child kicking in the womb. Could you feel it as well?

You are still listening, right? I know you are not actually my father, but thank you for listening nonetheless. Your glimmers of gold are a small comfort on my lonely journey."

## The Soldier

"Perhaps it is time for another story. Not much to distract myself with currently other than talking to you. I hope I can be of some amusement to you as well. Lets seeâ€¦ This is the story of the Soldier, who wanted nothing more than to protect those he cares about."

"The Soldier fought hard in a war he knew nothing about, so that his family at home would be safe. He killed for them, bled for them, until finally the war was over. With his enemies defeated, the Soldier returned home, but it was not as he remembered."

"The Soldier's daughter, that whom which he fought for, was missing. She had been taken by their ruler for a reason that The Soldier did not care to learn. He immediately picked up his rifle yet again, for he now knew that his duty was not yet finished."

"The Soldier arrived where they held his daughter, and did what he did best. Eventually leading her out of the carnage, they were met outside by other soldiers. Some, the Soldier knew. Some, he did not. It did not matter, for he would protect those he cares about."

"Bodies surrounded him. Bathed in their blood, the Soldier's daughter cried for him to stop, that she was safe, that they could go home. But the Soldier did not heed her words, for he knew there were still more out there who would hurt her. Only when everyone that could threaten his family were dead, could the Soldier rest. And so, with this blazing Ambition burning in his heart, the Soldier continued his sordid work."

"Months passed. Many tried to stop him, but the bonfire in his heart would not let him die. The Soldier killed and killed, until there was nothing left. Nobody left to harm his only daughter. But the Soldier's Ambition was not satisfied. It yet grew within him, greater and greater until he finally understood why. He looked around at the fields of bodies, the empty cities, his own hands stained with blood. "

"And moments later, the Soldier fulfilled his final act of duty, ridding his world of its final remaining threat. And his daughter was alone."

"My father told me a lot about those places, the Gardens of Iridesca. But he would never tell me what they were growing."

"Each Garden was a resplendent place, filled with angels, the Cultivators, who worked for the good of all, to shape and grow."

"Sadly I never got to visit a Garden, even after everything. Even if I did, it would have been long after its original purpose was concluded. No glorious angels left, only traitors."

"I... I think there is someone else out there, listening. I thought it was just you, but this is the second time I've noticed a fleeting connection. Hello? Is someone else out there? Do you like my stories?"

"I would have killed to have someone back on the island to tell stories to, or really just to talk to for that matter. Unfortunately, a seagull isn't the greatest listener. I tried anyway."

"And even after everything... Well, not much has changed. I now have an infinite amount of stories, and still nobody to listen. At least, until you came along."

"Oh! Where are my manners, I don't think I ever caught your name? Are you able to respond somehow?"

"I.. I heard you, faintly! That's a nice name, it sort of sounds like mine! Kind of?"

"But I do not understand one thing, are you descended from books? A lot has changed since I've been away!"

"Well then, Ella Grimoire, I shall regale you of more stories of my travels until your mind is overflowing!"
