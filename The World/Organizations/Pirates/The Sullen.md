### Encounters with The Sullen
- Â Our group ran into a seemingly abandoned ship but found that the Sullen had invaded it and turned the crew into the undead.
    - [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]] tried to negotiate the Sullen, but [[Vale]] and I intervened and we took down the Sullen
    - Their souls seemed to have escaped
