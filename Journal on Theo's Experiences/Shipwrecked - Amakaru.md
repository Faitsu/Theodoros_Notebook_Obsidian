- I was traveling from [[Portabora]] to the island of [[Amakaru]] to meet with the team who recruited me to participate in the [[Trial of Salt]]. A previous colleague of mine, [[Roland Dockson]], seems to also be participating in this trial and has approached me on this boat.  
- I had a strange dream of a young girl who was glowing white on an isolated island with a small shack and small, broken boat. She reached out to me and said "Remember me"
	- Addendum - It seems like this figure is [[Alune]], who is said to be the Mother of the Leviathans. But what is her connection to me? What does she want me to remember?
- [[Sons of Fire]] were encountered on the island of Amakaru after they assaulted our fleet of ships. They were the people who took down our fleet of ships to kidnap the representative of the Church of Salt, [[Melissa Aligar]], who is needed to enter the Trial of Salt.

	- Proclaimed their beliefs that the Church of Salt isn't enough to save Eilanaat and would rather restart the world
- We found the [[Leviathan of Amakaru]] dead as we were trying to find a town to seek help and find our captain, . The leviathan seemed to have died to the [[The Blight|Blight]], which has been affecting all the Leviathans
	- There were a few [[Deepspeakers]] who were eating the corpse of the Leviathan and died shortly after. 
	- Groupmates seemed interested in taking parts of the dead leviathan
- We traversed through a mine on the way to the Town of Amakaru. There was a [[Lock]] in the mines
	- [[]] was pulled into the Lock by the mysterious forces from the other side of the door but was stopped before she could go through.
