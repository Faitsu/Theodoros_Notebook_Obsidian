- I was traveling from [[Portabora]] to the island of [[Amakaru]] to meet with the team who recruited me to participate in the [[Trial of Salt]]. A previous colleague of mine, [[Roland Dockson]], seems to also be participating in this trial and has approached me on this boat.  
- I had a strange dream of a young girl who was glowing white on an isolated island with a small shack and small, broken boat. She reached out to me and said "Remember me"
