*"It has been a long time since I have stepped foot on this island; however, I did not come here to reminisce on old memories. I must ensure the Common Cause is successful in this final trial to secure my influence with the Church. I cannot fail here after coming so close to fulfilling this stepping stone. 

*...Knowing that home is close by, I cannot help but to wonder how father fares after all this time, but I do not think I can face him yet. " - Theodoros Delphi

- When we reached Portabora, we all split up to take care of business we had
	- Vale went on another date with Aligar. It seems like they ran into a reporter named Miss Bumblebee, who wanted to interview them due to our performance in the first trial. 
		- She also seemed concerned with orders the UNOC gave her. It seems like the UNOC is taking a more aggressive measure due to not having confidence in the church, and she is concerned with orders to return to her commanding officer
	- Ford went with the Captain to TUMs University to find out more information about the volcano on Portobora
		- Discussed with Professor Wildebank, a half orc Volcanology professor:
			- It is not naturally active, and the leviathan, Magnibora seems to regulate the volcano
				- The leviathan seems to feed off the ash of the volcano
			- Lava would be the primary hazard along with smoke
			- Magnibora does get visited by various figures and adventures, and there are even buildings within the volcano for travelers to rest in
		- The group also runs into Ford's classmate named Thalassa, who said she would like to travel with the group due to a vision she saw 
			- She saw this vision through a scroll, which also blinded her
		- I went to pay my respects to my former crewmates in an effort to move on from my past. I hope they rest in peace.
			- I also got Vale  a nice bouquet of white, blue, and gold roses to give Aligar as a gesture of appreciation for our conversation during our trip to Portobora. I do hope she can enjoy her time with the people she cares about. 
			- Roland pulled me aside to discuss his situation with his mother, who has sent people out to look for him. I told him he was free to stay on the ship and hide as long as he continued helping our crew. 
				- Opinion: It seems I have caught myself opening up to people for no particular reason...I'm not sure how to feel about this but I will not push them aside like I had before. Maybe this change is what I need.
		- I do not know what the boy was up to during this time. in fact, I have noticed I do not have good records on the boy's whereabouts during the crew's down time. As long as he does not get himself into trouble and is not in the way of the crew's efforts to prepare for our task, I do not mind, it is his personal time after all. 
- The Sea Elf suggested to go to dinner at a specific tavern in the Firelight district since we were looking to scout out the Cat's Eye crew and they were known to frequent those parts
	- Pasca expressed interest in meeting the Cat's Eye to have them help her rescue her island from the grasps of the Sullen. We forgot to bring her as we had other, higher, priorities to take care of
	- The Captain does not seem to be in the greatest of moods, I will keep my eye out
- The crew went to go meet the Cat's Eye, which did not go as smoothly as planned
	- Before the meeting, there was a disagreement with how we should approach the Cat's Eye. Ford insisted she would call herself captain if the Captain did not want to speak with the Cat's Eye. This did not seem to better the Captain's mood. 
		- Opinion: What was the point of this? This is information that is easily debunkable, and there is no benefit here in tricking the Cat's Eye. This would only bring detriment to the Captain's already sour mood. This behavior needs to be addressed. 
	- Cat's Eye seemed prepared for a trip into the volcano
	- We got a general sense of their crew:
		- Luden - Captain of the crew, but it is hard to pinpoint his specialty in combat. Generic
		- Thordak - Quartermaster, fighter. Seems to be quiet and a man of few words
		- Boblin - Unsure of his role on the crew, but Vale pointed out his shotgun. Seems to be a rouge of some kind
		- Gerald - First Mate - Paladin. Loud, boisterous, prideful, not smart.
		- Gray Oakwood - Druid from the UNOC
		- Caitlyn - Doctor - Celestial Warlock. Mysterious sort
		- Pepper Hotfoot - Chef - Not sure of fighting capabilities. Hot headed
	- Ford negotiated with them to be cordial and to not kill each other during the trials
	- Ford introduced herself as the Captain of the crew, in which shortly after, our real captain disappeared. I was not happy with this situation and it would be danger
