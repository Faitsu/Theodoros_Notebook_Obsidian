*"It has been a long time since I have stepped foot on this island; however, I did not come here to reminisce on old memories. I must ensure the Common Cause is successful in this final trial to secure my influence with the Church. I cannot fail here after coming so close to fulfilling this stepping stone. 

*...Knowing that home is close by, I cannot help but to wonder how my father fares after all this time, but I do not think I can face him yet. " - Theodoros Delphi
