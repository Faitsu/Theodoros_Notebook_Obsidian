*"It has been a long time since I have stepped foot on this island; however, I did not come here to reminisce on old memories. I must ensure the Common Cause is successful in this final trial to secure my influence with the Church. I cannot fail here after coming so close to fulfilling this stepping stone. 

*...Knowing that home is close by, I cannot help but to wonder how father fares after all this time, but I do not think I can face him yet. " - Theodoros Delphi

- When we reached Portabora, we all split up to take care of business we had
	- Vale went on another date with Aligar. It seems like they ran into a reporter named Miss Bumblebee, who wanted to interview them due to our performance in the first trial. 
		- She also seemed concerned with orders the UNOC gave her. It seems like the UNOC is taking a more aggressive measure due to not having confidence in the church, and she is concerned with orders to return to her commanding officer
	- Ford went with the Captain to TUMs University to find out more information about the volcano on Portobora
		- Discussed with Professor Wildebank, a half orc Volcanology professor:
			- It is not naturally active, and the leviathan, Magnibora seems to regulate the volcano
				- The leviathan seems to feed off the ash of the volcano
			- Lava would be the primary hazard along with smoke
			- Magnibora does get visited by various figures and adventures, and there are even buildings within the volcano for travelers to rest in
		- The group also runs into Ford's classmate named Thalassa, who said she would like to travel with the group due to a vision she saw 
			- She saw this vision through a scroll, which also blinded her
		- I went to pay my respects to my former crewmates in an effort to move on from my past. I hope they rest in peace.
			- I also got Vale some flowers to give Aligar as a gesture of appreciation for our conversation during our trip to Portobora. I do hope she can enjoy her time with the people she cares about. 
			- Roland pulled me aside to discuss his situation with his mother, who has sent people out to look for him. I told him he was free to stay on the ship and hide as long as he continued helping our crew. 
				- Opinion: It seems I have caught myself opening up to people for no particular reason...I'm not sure how to feel about this but I will not push them aside like I had before. Maybe this change is what I need.
		- I do not know what the boy was up to during this time. What *does* he do in his free time?
