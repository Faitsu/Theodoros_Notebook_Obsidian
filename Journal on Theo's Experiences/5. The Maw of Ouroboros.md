*"Our crew's tribulations begin here. Hopefully, our efforts to prepare for the trials will pay off. We'll get you your help soon, *redacted*" -Theodoros Delphi 

- Before leaving for the Maw, we were able to learn about what four crews we would be facing 
	- [[Blood Rippers]] - Led by [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] [[Captain Lazarus Jr|Lazarus]] Jr., Pirates
	- [[Sons of Fire]] - Led by the [[Lady of Flames]], Pirates
	- [[Storm Chasers]] - Led by Zezzari Thunderborn, a Civilian/Adventuring crew consisting mainly of Dragonborns
- The instructions for the trial were simple - find the [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] of Pearl in the depths of the ocean by the Maw of Ouroboros, and whoever reached the church back with the pearl would pass the trials
- Our crew found a whirlpool that spun in a different direction, and we tried to have our crew sail in another direction to trick the other contestants
- The whirlpool took us to a chasm that led to some underwater ruins, which seemed to have belonged to the Profound
    - Creatures:
        - Flash Seaweed - would blind a person who touched the seaweed
        - Whisperfish - fish that lure unsuspecting prey using impersonations of people's voices before ambushing them. They can command their foes to do their bidding
        - Red tube-like creatures - restrains people who are not fast enough
        - Crab - has a deceptively large and toothy maw that it hides
        - Angler fish - lures in prey using the human decoy attached to it
	- Writing found on a rock: 
		-  "May this place serve as a monument to the [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]]. May her everlasting duty grant this world an era of tranquility."
		- Note: I was shocked to learn that I could read what seemed to be celestial. The words just made...sense to me
	- [[Avery Vale|Vale]] and the [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] found a block of tidlelite in shipwrecked ship on the way 
- Within the ruins was a large tower where we found a very large, dead celestial along with the pearl needed for the Trial
	- The tower seemed to have multiple layers to it; as if the power was repurposed multiple times
	- Areas of the tower: 
		- Library area - had documents about celestials
			- Tablet: "We remember the service of the Cultivators, may they pave the way for the future of this planet"
			- Tablet 2: "May the Prisoners persevere. In the eras to come, our work shall ensure they will be free again."
			- Tablet 3: After careful discussion and persuasion, the Cultivators may now take on wards of our children of hope: Hadriel, Galadriel, [[Satiniel]].
			- Tablet 4: An application to tend the Grove from [[Satiniel]]
			    - "Where it began, I will continue my duty as long as I am able
				    - Conjecture: Is this talking about his uprising?
		- Map room - had a map with locations of the [[Lock|Locks]]
			-  **Locations of [[Lock|Locks]]** (Through an old vision of Eilanaat on an old map):
				- Portabora: Inside [[The Volcano, Magnibora|the Volcano]]
				- [[Amakaru]]: Beneath a mountain
				- Fortessa: Center of Island
				- Swallow's Heart: In the Sky
				- [[Corrolai]]: Where the Cathedral currently is
				- [[Margrave]]: Where the [[Sons of Fire]] base is
				- Primal Belt: Slowly moving around the Primal belt, possibly on the turtle's back
				- Addendum: There seems to be a secret [[Lock]], known only to [[The Caretaker, Hami'Toa|Hami'toa]] and possibly the deep speakers who converse with him
		- Dead celestial room
			- When touching The Golden Pearl, we see a vision of [[Alune]] on the same island with the ram shacked boat
			    - She claims her father destroyed her ship
			    - The vision was similar to  my dreams from [[Amakaru]], though the girl was taller in the previous dream
			- The [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] of Pearl spawned to defend the pearl
				- Last words: "My duty has come to an end, I hope you know what you are doing"
			- The [[Blood Rippers]] were on our tail, so we were forced to retreat, but they did not give chase. Rather, they started collecting the armor pieces off the dead celestial
- We went back to our ship, only to find that the [[Sons of Fire]] had raided our ship and taken our crew hostage so they could ambush and negotiate with us
	- Due to our meddling at their headquarters and their main source of damage being fire, they took over our ship so they would not have to fight in the water. 
	- They knew the church would not want them to win, so they wanted us to win. However, in exchange, they would mark one of us so they could track us while we were in the Lower Tail
	- We had a plan to distract them until we sailed close enough to the edge of the Maw of Ouroboros, where we would launch [[Avery Vale|Vale]] towards the [[Church of Salt]] ship to end the trial and have the Church intervene with our situation 
	- The Seraphim had the ability to prevent us all from fighting 
		- I felt her presence sometime during this encounter, I cannot recall when
	- Note: This was all told to me after the fact...I can barely remember anything from this moment...all I saw were the flashes of memories of flames and my former allies being cut down by pirates...It seemed like I had a hand at scaring off the [[Sons of Fire]], but I need to work on myself. I cannot let the past cloud my judgment like so. I need to figure out what I am and how to control myself.
- After the trial, we had a talk with Darius (who was promoted here) and the High Prophet
	- Knows about [[Alune]] who is known as the "[[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]]" of the Leviathans
	- Notified us that the final stage of the trials is in two weeks, at Portabora.
		- We will be facing the [[Cat's Eye]] - led by Ludin, the generic half elf
	- Church seems weary of the thing behind [[Lock|the Lock]]
	- Rewards:
		- Golden Censer
		- Amulet which can heal
		- 8000g
- In an effort to fix my issues, I attempted to converse with the Seraphim, whom I could not understand. She tried to point out that I was a *Child of Hope*
	- It was hard to tell from afar, but up close, the Seraphim I conversed with seemed sick
- In our downtime, [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]] was able to find this information:
	- [[King of Games]]: There is a story of a [[Lemuel Sanguine|boy]] who wanted to play games with an imaginary friend, but the imaginary friend was actually the [[King of Games]]. He is not exactly kind though and would play "games" with people
	- Notable Warlocks: Aeon Araval, an arch-fey warlock on Fortessa
- My own research: 
	- [[Satiniel]] & Cultivators: info comes from outside Eilanaat from Ismuth. It talks about ancient ruins - the gardens of Iridesca, ruled by the cultivators. Though it is unknown what exactly the cultivators were growing, it was of great power and it was said that it even powered planets
    - [[Satiniel]] was one of these cultivators who at one point usurped another garden through an uprising. This resulted in an unknown part of history afterwards. This era did not end until 1000-2000 years
	- [[Alune]]: There is a mythological tale from the Lower tails - "The story of the Girl", but the details of the tale is unknown
- In an attempt to learn more about myself, I decided to approach [[Bishop Darius|Arch Bishop]] Darius with a deal where I asked for the following:
	- Assistance with curing my childhood friend with Golden Salt
		- Told the [[Bishop Darius|Arch Bishop]] about how her illness was related to the profound, and since the golden salt might be related to the profound, he's hoping it could help her
	- Training for my deep speaker abilities
	- The [[Bishop Darius|Arch Bishop]] agreed to the deal, where he would assist me with training to control my deep speaker powers
		- In return, I will share more info with Darius and will assist Church with gathering more info about prophecies
	- I learned that deep speakers can speak and command leviathans to protect the islands. They also harness their abilities through strange dreams, and their powers usually manifest when they are going through puberty.
	- It seems like I was a late bloomer since most deep speakers got their powers during puberty
		- Addendum: It is because I am a different type of deep speaker, "one born from battle"
- The [[Lemuel Sanguine|boy]], [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]], and the [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] found a strange man on our ship, who was trying to hide a dagger he had stolen from the Church. We took the dagger from this man
    - Conjecture: Why would this man and the Church go through so much effort for this dagger? This must be a powerful tool that we could utilize.
