*"Our crew's tribulations begin here. Hopefully, our efforts to prepare for the trials will pay off. We'll get you your help soon, Lynn" -Theodoros Delphi 

*"We might have won the trials, but I do not know how to process what had happened. I will use my time at [[Corrolai]] to recuperateâ€¦What am I?" -Theodoros Delphi*

- Before leaving for the Maw, we were able to learn about what four crews we would be facing 
	- [[Blood Rippers]] - Led by [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] [[Captain Lazarus Jr|Lazarus]] Jr., Pirates
	- [[Sons of Fire]] - Led by the [[Lady of Flames]], Pirates
	- [[Storm Chasers]] - Led by - Zezzari Thunderborn, Civilian/Adventuring crew consisting of mainly Dragonborns
- The instructions for the trial were simple - find the [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] of Pearl in the depths of ocean by the Maw of Ouroboros, and whomever reaches the church back with the pearl would pass the trials
- Our crew found a whirlpool which spun in a different direction, and we tried to have our crew sail in another direction to trick the other contestants
- The whirlpool took us to a chasm that lead to some underwater ruins, which seemed to have belonged to the Profound
    - Creatures:
        - Flash Seaweed - would blind a person who touched the seaweed
        - Whisperfish - fish which lure unsuspecting prey using impersonations of people's voices before ambushing them. They also have the ability to command their foes to do their bidding
        - Red tube-like creatures - restrain people who are not fast enough
        - Crab - has deceptively large and toothy maw that it hides
        - Angler fish - lures in prey using the human decoy attached to it
	- Writing found on a rock: 
		-  "May this place serve as a monument to the [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]]. May her everlasting duty grant this world an era of tranquility."
		- Note: I was shocked to learn that I could read what seemed to to be celestial. The words just made...sense to me
	- [[Avery Vale|Vale]] and the [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] found a block of tidlelite in shipwrecked ship on the way 
- Within the ruins was a large tower where we found a very large, dead celestial along with the pearl needed for the Trial
	- The tower seemed to have multiple layers to it; as if the power was repurposed multiple times
	- Areas of the tower: 
		- Library area - had documents about celestials
			- Tablet: "We remember the service of the cultivators, may they pave the way for the future of this planet"
			- Tablet 2: "May the Prisoners persevere. In the eras to come, our work shall ensure they will be free again."
			- Tablet 3: After careful discussion and persuasion, the cultivators may now take on wards of our children of hope: Hadriel, Gadriel, [[Satiniel]].
			- Tablet 4: An application to tend the Grove from [[Satiniel]]
			    - "Where it began, I will continue my duty as long as I am able
				    - Conjecture: Is this talking about his uprising?
		- Map room - had a map with locations of the [[Lock|Locks]]
			-  **Locations of [[Lock|Locks]]** (Through an old vision of Eilanaat on an old map):
				- Portabora: Inside [[The Volcano, Magnibora|the Volcano]]
				- [[Amakaru]]: Beneath a mountain
				- Fortessa: Center of Island
				- Swallow's Heart: In the Sky
				- [[Corrolai]]: Where the Cathedral currently is
				- [[Margrave]]: Where the [[Sons of Fire]] base is
				- Primal Belt: [[United Natural Order Coalition|UNOC]] Base
				- Addendum: There seems to be a secret [[Lock]], known only to [[The Caretaker, Hami'Toa|Hami'toa]] and possibly the deep speakers who converse with him
		- Dead celestial room
			- When touching The Golden Pearl, we see a vision of [[Alune]] on the same island with the ram shacked boat
			    - She claims her father destroyed her ship
			    - The vision was similar to  my dreams from [[Amakaru]], though the girl was taller in the previous dream
			- The [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] of Pearl spawned to defend the pearl
				- Last words: "My duty has come to an end, I hope you know what you are doing"
			- The [[Blood Rippers]] were on our tail, so we were forced to retreat, but they did not give chase. Rather, they started collecting the armor pieces off the dead celestial
- We went back to our ship, only to find that the [[Sons of Fire]] raided our ship and took our crew hostage so they could ambush and negotiate with us
	- Due to our meddling at their headquarters and their main source of damage being fire, the took over our ship so they would not have to fight in the water. 
	- They knew the church would not want them to win, so they wanted us to win. However, in exchange, they would mark one of us so they could track us while we were in the Lower Tail
	- Note: This was all told to me after the fact...I can barely remember anything from this moment...all I saw were the flashes of memories of flames and my former allies being cut down by pirates...It seemed like I had a hand at scaring off the [[Sons of Fire]], but I need to work on myself. I cannot let the past cloud my judgement like so. I need to figure out what I am and how to control myself.
