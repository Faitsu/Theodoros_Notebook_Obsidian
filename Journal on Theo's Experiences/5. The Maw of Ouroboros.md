*"Our crew's tribulations begin here. Hopefully, our efforts to prepare for the trials will pay off. We'll get you your help soon, Lynn" -Theodoros Delphi 

*"We might have won the trials, but I do not know how to process what had happened. I will use my time at Corrolai to recuperateâ€¦What am I?" -Theodoros Delphi*

- Before leaving for the Maw, we were able to learn about what four crews we would be facing 
	- [[Blood Rippers]] - Led by Captain Lazarus Jr., Pirates
	- [[Sons of Fire]] - Led by the Lady of Flames, Pirates
	- [[Storm Chasers]] - Led by - Zezzari Thunderborn, Civilian/Adventuring crew consisting of mainly Dragonborns
- The instructions for the trial were simple - find the Mother of Pearl in the depths of ocean by the Maw of Ouroboros, and whomever reaches the church back with the pearl would pass the trials
- Our crew found a whirlpool which spun in a different direction, and we tried to have our crew sail in another direction to trick the other contestants
- The whirlpool took us to a chasm that lead to some underwater ruins, which seemed to have belonged to the Profound
    - Creatures:
        - Flash Seaweed - would blind a person who touched the seaweed
        - Whisperfish - fish which lure unsuspecting prey using impersonations of people's voices before ambushing them. They also have the ability to command their foes to do their bidding
        - Red tube-like creatures - restrain people who are not fast enough
        - Crab - has deceptively large and toothy maw that it hides
        - Angler fish - lures in prey using the human decoy attached to it
	- Writing found on a rock: 
		-  "May this place serve as a monument to the Mother. May her everlasting duty grant this world an era of tranquility."
		- Note: I was shocked to learn that I could read what seemed to to be celestial. The words just made...sense to me
	- Vale and the Captain found a block of tidlelite in shipwrecked ship on the way 
- Within the ruins was a large tower where we found a very large, dead celestial along with the pearl needed for the Trial
	- The tower seemed to have multiple layers to it; as if the power was repurposed multiple times
	- Areas of the tower: 
		- Library area - had documents about celestials
			- Tablet: "We remember the service of the cultivators, may they pave the way for the future of this planet"
			- Tablet 2: "May the Prisoners persevere. In the eras to come, our work shall ensure they will be free again."
			- Tablet 3: After careful discussion and persuasion, the cultivators may now take on wards of our children of hope: Hadriel, Gadriel, Satiniel.
			- Tablet 4: An application to tend the Grove from Satiniel
			    - "Where it began, I will continue my duty as long as I am able
				    - Conjecture: Is this talking about his uprising?
		- Map room - had a map with locations of the Locks
			-  **Locations of Locks** (Through an old vision of Eilnaat on an old map):
				- Portabora: Inside the Volcano
				- Amakaru: Beneath a mountain
				- Fortessa: Center of Island
				- Swallow's Heart: In the Sky
				- Corrolai: Where the Cathedral currently is
				- Margrave: Where the Sons of Fire base is
				- Primal Belt: UNOC Base
				- Addendum: There seems to be a secret Lock, known only to Hami'toa and possibly the deep speakers who converse with him
		- Dead celestial room
			- When touching The Golden Pearl, we see a vision of Alune on the same 
			    - She claims her father destroyed her ship
        
    - Vision very similar to Theodoros' dream in session 0, though the girl was taller in his dream
