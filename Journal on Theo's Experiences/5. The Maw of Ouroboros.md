- Before leaving for the Maw, we were able to learn about what four crews we would be facing 
	- [[Blood Rippers]] - Led by Captain Lazarus Jr., Pirates
	- [[Sons of Fire]] - Led by the Lady of Flames, Pirates
	- [[Storm Chasers]] - Led by - Zezzari Thunderborn, Civilian/Adventuring crew consisting of mainly Dragonborns
- The instructions for the trial were simple - find the Mother of Pearl in the depths of ocean by the Maw of Ouroboros, and whomever reaches the church back with the pearl would pass the trials
- Our crew found a whirlpool which spun in a different direction, and we tried to have our crew sail in another direction to trick the other contestants
- The whirlpool took us to underwater ruins, which seemed to have belonged to the Profound
    - Creatures:
        - Flash Seaweed - would blind a person who touched the seaweed

        - Angler fish that has human decoy attached to it
