*"Due to the situation at Amakaru, our crew is forced to take a detour from figuring out how to participate in the Trial of Salt to try instead to cure the sleep paralysis plaguing our captain and the entire island. Our current roster consists of two civilians, one college student, a druid in training, and two mercenaries, one missing an arm. This will be a long mission" -Theodoros Delphi*

- We went to a small Archipelago and came into contact with [[Alister Renedee|Mr.Renedee]], who said he could help us create a cure for the condition of the people of [[Amakaru]] if we could bring him the hair of a [[Light Bender]]

-  On the way back to Amakaru, [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]] prompted the group to play a game to get to know everyone on the ship better. Though I prefer to keep my personal life to myself, some interesting pieces of information came to surface:
	- [[Avery Vale|Vale]] - is on her Wandering, a tradition in the UNOC where a trainee goes on a special mission to promote to the next rank, in her case, becoming a warden
	- The boy seems to have a particular interest in me, which I must keep an eye on as I do not want his personal business interfering with my goals
		- The boy also seems to come from an isolated village in
