*"Due to the situation at Amakaru, our crew is forced to take a detour from figuring out how to participate in the Trial of Salt to try instead to cure the sleep paralysis plaguing our captain and the entire island. Our current roster consists of two civilians, one college student, a druid in training, and two mercenaries, one missing an arm. This will be a long mission" -Theodoros Delphi*

- We went to a small Archipelago and came into contact with [[Alister Renedee|Mr.Renedee]], who said he could help us create a cure for the condition of the people of [[Amakaru]] if we could bring him the hair of a [[Light Bender]]
	- He offered extra rewards for not killing the creature
- We set off to fight three [[Displacer Beasts]] and the Light Bender
	- The Displacer Beasts went around of defenses and attempted to kill the [[Lemuel Sanguine|Boy]] first
		- He was brought down and much of our efforts went into protecting him
	- I lost control of myself during the fight with the Light Bender and attempted to chase after it with the intent to kill. I assume it was due to the effects of the drugs the [[Vivienne the Coward|Hobgoblin Woman]] gave me
		- Addendum: It seems like there is more to this than just the drugs as I did not act like this after taking Dream Lily during further encounters. It seems to put me in a state similar to the one I go under when my deepspeaker abilities manifests. *Why* this happens, however, is beyond my understanding
-  On the way back to Amakaru
