*"Now that the civilians of [[Amakaru]] are saved, we can focus on our main task: the [[Trial of Salt]]. However, we must dive into enemy territory to rescue the [[Melissa Aligar|cleric]] who will start our trials. I hope my reputation will not get in the way of these endeavors; I will need to discuss this with the crew. " -Theodoros Delphi*

- To access the island, we decided to make a trade deal with the pirate group known as the [[Blood Rippers]], and said we would trade them booze and Mithril for gold
	- There were three different groups of pirates we could have made a deal with:
		-  [[The Sullen|Sullen]]
		- [[Blood Rippers]]
		-  [[Mind Melters]]
- On our journey to [[Margrave]] we encountered a seemingly abandoned ship
	- [[The Sullen]] had killed the crew on the ship to recruit for their crew. The pirates were swiftly dealt with
	- We found a survivor on this ship, a Tiefling young girl named [[Pasca]]
		- Seemed to get along with the [[Lemuel Sanguine|Boy]]
- The [[Lemuel Sanguine|boy]] and his [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] seemed to get into a few arguments, which seemed to negatively affect the [[Vivienne the Coward|mother]]'s productivity. In an effort to staunch the drop in her efficacy, I attempted to talk to her about her troubles
	- She mentions that she killed the [[Lemuel Sanguine|boy]]'s biological [[Vivienne the Coward|mother]] and took him in due to guilt
	- I divulge to her my relationship with my own father, as my father's treatment of me reminded me of the [[Vivienne the Coward|Hobgoblin Woman]]'s treatment of her son, and from experience, it would be better to be honest with her son rather than give in to all of his whims
- We encountered the [[Plaguebringer]] as we approached [[Margrave]], in which it took the symbol we got from the [[Blood Rippers]], but the [[Vivienne the Coward|hobgoblin woman]] also fed the creature the flesh of the dead [[The Phantom|leviathan from Amakaru]] 
	- Addendum: The flesh caused [[Plaguebringer|the plaguebringer]] to go on a rampage
- At the [[Sons of Fire]] Headquarters, we split up into two different groups
	- [[Avery Vale|Vale]] and the [[Vivienne the Coward|hobgoblin woman]]  scaled up the headquarters to break out the [[Melissa Aligar|cleric]]
	- The [[Lemuel Sanguine|boy]], [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]] and I went to go find a ship to escape in
		-  **Cargo on SoF Ship:** MJ (Moon Jelly) Tentacles labels were seen on the cargo the SoF's ship had, along with a box that said LS (Loach Scales) and LSS (Liquified Squid)
	    - In the box were loach scales
	        - Used for potions of water breathing
            - Needs two other ingredients
            - Takes 100g to make water-breathing potions
- The break out was successful, but we were chased by the [[Lady of Flames]] while escaping on the ship. We were in a losing fight to her, but [[Plaguebringer|the Plaguebringer]] destroyed our ship during his rampage 
	-  She held back during our fight with her; however, she did almost down [[Avery Vale|Avery]] in one round of attacks
	- She used to be a part of the [[United Natural Order Coalition|UNOC]], but she said her training regimen was what opened her eyes
    - She asked [[Avery Vale|Vale]] what plane she was sent to and said that she was sent to the plane of flames
        - [[Avery Vale|Vale]] had no idea what she was talking about
	- [[Avery Vale|Vale]] seemed unusually adamant on protecting [[Melissa Aligar|Aligar]] from the assailant
- We land on the island of [[Margrave]] after getting shipwrecked, and we had to travel to the Pirate Town in order to escape the island
	- The island was covered in a haze of red mist from [[Plaguebringer|the Plaguebringer]], which spawned hostile creatures
	- The [[Sons of Fire]] also had forces waiting for us on the island, and we had to engage with [[General Vinn]]
		- I had seemed to have lost most of my memory during this point, but according to the group I had manifested a helmet made of black mist and angel wings, and I had beheaded the general's corpse and put it on a pike. 
			- I do remember hearing a scream from what I assumed was the leviathan: 
				- "I REMEMBER MY DUTY. I MUST PROTECT WITH WHAT LIFE REMAINS WITHIN ME. HER TIME HAS NEARLY COME."
	- The pirates of [[Margrave]] seemed to have recognized who I was, and the [[Vivienne the Coward|hobgoblin woman]] had to step in to make sure we would not run into more trouble
	- I saw the [[deepspeakers]] converse with the leviathan, but no one else was able to hear them
	    - Words from [[Deepspeakers]]: "Do not forget your duty to protect the people."
	    - Leviathan's Response to the [[Deepspeakers]]: "Traitor…Protect [[Vivienne the Coward|mother]]
		    - See, you understand, guardian, [[Vivienne the Coward|mother]]
		- This is where the group and I realized I might be a deepspeaker. 
			- Opinion: I have a name to what I could possibly be, but it opens more questions about what I am and the mysterious bouts I fall into. Why didn't we see other deepspeakers form angel wings or decent into rage? How can I manifest my abilities safely like the other deepspeakers? Am I truly one of them? And if so, *why* was I separated from them?
