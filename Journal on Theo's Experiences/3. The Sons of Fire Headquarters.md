*"Now that the civilians of Amakaru are saved, we can focus on our main task: the Trial of Salt. However, we must dive into enemy territory to rescue the cleric who will start our trials. I hope my reputation will not get in the way of these endeavors; I will need to discuss this with the crew. " -Theodoros Delphi*

- On our journey to [[Margrave]] we encountered a seemingly abandoned ship
	- [[The Sullen]] had killed the crew on the ship to recruit for their crew. The pirates were swiftly dealt with
	- We found a survivor on this ship, a Tiefling young girl named [[Pasca]]
		- Seemed to get along with the [[Lemuel Sanguine|Boy]]
- [[Sheera Arrendale|Arrendale]] shares with us information on the three pirate groups:
	- [[The Sullen|Sullen]]
	- [[Blood Rippers]]
	- [[Mind Melters]]
- The boy and his [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] seemed to get into a few arguments, which seemed to negatively affect the mother's productivity. In an effort to staunch the drop in her efficacy, I attempted to talk to her about her troubles
	- She mentions that she killed the boy's biological mother and took him in due to guilt
	- I divulge to her my relationship with my own father, as my father's treatment of me reminded me of the [[Vivienne the Coward|Hobgoblin Woman]]'s treatment of her son, and from experience, it would be better to be honest with her son rather than give in to all of his whims
- We encountered the [[Plaguebringer]] as we approached Margrave, in which it took a symbol [[Sheera Arrendale|Arrendale]] had to give to it, but the hobgoblin woman also fed the creature the flesh of the dead [[The Phantom|leviathan from Amakaru]]
