*"We have won the trials, but our victory only marks the beginning of this journey. For the sake of those I care about, I will do my best to save Eilanaat, even if it means working with the misguided church or stubborn UNOC. I will do anything to keep them safe. 

*I also hope to answer some questions about myself and my friend's condition while we are at the Lower Tail. My promise to you will be fulfilled, father" -Theodoros Delphi*

- Before leaving Portobora, we had recruited a few of the Cat's Eye to join our crew
	-  Boblin the Goblin
	- Gerald Sungaze
- The King of Games appeared to Ford and spoke to her. She later told us that the King of Games wanted her to sabotage their efforts to save the Leviathans and kill them.
	- The King of Games was not happy with this, and though he let Ford keep her powers, he told us he will be finding other ways to get in our way 
	- The Boy seemed to have had a talk with the King of Games, but claimed to not have taken a deal with him
		- Opinion: I am concerned by this. Along with the dagger, there is real potential for the boy to be tempted and to get in the way of our main tasks. While we can watch the situation as he has not shown any real signs of betrayal, steps to intervene should be taken.
- Long Night is coming up, and in an attempt of good will and keeping the traditions my father passed on to me, I got the main group and some of the other crew members gifts:
	- Dockson: A nice tapestry of Iridesca
	- Sungaze: Armor Polish
	- Vale: A new cloak
	- Ford: A new blue notebook with butterflies on it and a matching pen
	- Boy: A sheathe for his dagger
	- Captain: A bed for her pets
- We head towards Azir Ennore, where we were given the laws of the land by Marshall Delalin
	- Vale goes to talk to her superiors about her promotion
		- She did not get her promotion and was stuck with trying to figure out the form her superiors were looking for
			- She said it had to do with her meditation, which she cannot remember, and if she forces it she would die
		- Her next mission is to accompany us to the Lower Belt
	- The Captain goes off on her own
	- Ford, the Boy, Sungaze, wanted to go explore the city, and I was tasked with accompanying them. 
		- The boy seemed to have wanted to garner my attention by hanging out with Sungaze.
			- Opinion: The man is more suitable to be his mentor than I. If that ends up to be what happens, then I have no qualms
		- The boy and Ford get in to a scuffle and started to cause a scene. Due to Sungaze's advice to hash out their issues now rather than to wait later, I pull them to a secluded corner to hash out their concerns
			- The boy denies any feelings for me, but
