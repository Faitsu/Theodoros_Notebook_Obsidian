*"We have won the trials, but our victory only marks the beginning of this journey. For the sake of those I care about, I will do my best to save Eilanaat, even if it means working with the misguided church or stubborn UNOC. I will do anything to keep them safe. 

*I also hope to answer some questions about myself and my friend's condition while we are at the Lower Tail. My promise to you will be fulfilled, father" -Theodoros Delphi*

- Before leaving Portobora, we had recruited a few of the Cat's Eye to join our crew
	-  Boblin the Goblin
	- Gerald Sungaze
- The King of Games appeared to Ford and spoke to her. She later told us that the King of Games wanted her to sabotage their efforts to save the Leviathans and kill them.
	- The King of Games was not happy with this, and though he let Ford keep her powers, he told us he will be finding other ways to get in our way 
	- The Boy seemed to have had a talk with the King of Games, but claimed to not have taken a deal with him
		- Opinion: I am concerned by this. Along with the dagger, there is real potential for the boy to be tempted and to get in the way of our main tasks. While we can watch the situation as he has not shown any real signs of betrayal, steps to intervene should be taken.
- Long Night is coming up, and in an attempt at good will and keeping the traditions my father passed on to me, I got the main group and some of the other crew members gifts:
	- Dockson: A nice tapestry of Iridesca
	- Sungaze: Armor Polish
	- Vale: A new cloak
	- Ford: A new blue notebook with butterflies on it and a matching pen
	- Boy: A sheathe for his dagger
	- Captain: A bed for her pets
- We head towards Azir Ennore, where we were given the laws of the land by Marshall Delalin
	- Vale goes to talk to her superiors about her promotion
		- She did not get her promotion and was stuck with trying to figure out the form her superiors were looking for
			- She said it had to do with her meditation, which she cannot remember, and if she forces it she would die
		- Her next mission is to accompany us to the Lower Belt
	- The Captain goes off on her own
	- Ford, the Boy, Sungaze, wanted to go explore the city, and I was tasked with accompanying them. 
		- We attempt to visit the Greenhouse of Life, a place where the druids of the UNOC go to revere in nature. Though they do not worship one particular god as a culture, this temple is dedicated to Lii, the primal god of life
		- The boy seemed to have wanted to garner my attention by hanging out with Sungaze.
			- Opinion: The man is more suitable to be his mentor than I. If that ends up to be what happens, then I have no qualms
		- The boy and Ford get in to a scuffle and started to cause a scene. Due to Sungaze's advice to hash out their issues now rather than to wait later, I pull them to a secluded corner to hash out their concerns
			- The boy denies any feelings for me, but to the very least, he seems to have some ulterior motive for wanting my attention. I had expressed my opinions of romance explicitly, so it is up to the boy to decide what to do. I will continue to give him the truth if pushed more
			- Ford is concerned with the boy's dealings with the King of Games. The boy says he was tempted but did not take any deal
			- Ford seems to be acting differently since our encounter with the King of Games.
				- Biased Observation & opinion: She seems less confident and more nervous. She also claims to have forgotten many of the details of our travels. We cannot have her forgetting key information during our travels as our journey to the Lower Tail will be perilous and will require the team's coordination. So, despite my lack of trust in the woman, I will lend her my journal after this conversation ends between her and the boy. 
					- *There is a pinned note on this page* If you read this Ford, know that I will be watching to see if your actions from here reflect what you told me in the conversation above. Your actions before have sowed many seeds of distrust, and the King of Games watching over is an active enemy. This action is a sign of starting with a clean slate, but due to your relations with the King of Games, I have redacted some information in the journal. Do not disappoint.
- *In a piece of paper he will stick into this journal later* I had done some research in my free time to understand what we might be facing in the future:
	- Okoto, the wandering grove is a giant sea turtle that patrols the Primal Belt. There is a city ontop of its back that houses deep speakers
	- Deep Speakers - and Eisoteric group that are traditionally very closed of and mysterious. They wear masks called "muzzles" to show their dedication for being uncorrupted by outside influences since they know they have to be responsible with the power they have to talk to leviathans. 
		- Some deep speakers are revered while others are seen as lesser. An example of this can be seen in Margrave, where the deep speakers there are enslaved. 
		- There is a legendary figure who travelled around the world and returned knowing how to speak to the leviathans
		- There is also another legend of a profound, a golden, resplendent, figure who gained the ability to command the leviathans during a battle. Behind him was a golden start in the sky
- Hadriel and Galadriel -
