*"We have won the trials, but our victory only marks the beginning of this journey. For the sake of those I care about, I will do my best to save Eilanaat, even if it means working with the misguided church or stubborn UNOC. I will do anything to keep them safe. 

*I also hope to answer some questions about myself and my friend's condition while we are at the Lower Tail. My promise to you will be fulfilled, father" -Theodoros Delphi*

- Before leaving Portobora, we had recruited a few of the Cat's Eye to join our crew
	-  Boblin the Goblin
	- Gerald Sungaze
- The King of Games appeared to Ford and spoke to her. She later told us that the King of Games wanted her to sabotage their efforts to save the Leviathans and kill them.
	- The King of Games was not happy with this, and though he let Ford keep her powers, he told us he will be finding other ways to get in our way 
	- The Boy seemed to have had a talk with the King of Games, but claimed to not have taken a deal with him
		- Opinion: I am concerned by this. Along with the dagger, there is real potential for the boy to be tempted and to get in the way of our main tasks. While we can watch the situation as he has not shown any real signs of betrayal, steps to intervene should be taken.
- Long Night is coming up, and in an attempt of good will and keeping the traditions my father passed on to me, I got the main group and some of the other crew members gifts:
	-  Roland: A nice tapestry of Iridesca
	- Gerald: Armor Polish
