*"We have won the trials, but our victory only marks the beginning of this journey. For the sake of my father and Lynn, I will do my best to save Eilanaat, even if it means working with the misguided church or stubborn UNOC. I will do anything to keep them safe. 

*I also hope to answer some questions about myself and Lynn's condition while we are at the Lower Tail. My promise to you will be fulfilled, father" -Theodoros Delphi*
