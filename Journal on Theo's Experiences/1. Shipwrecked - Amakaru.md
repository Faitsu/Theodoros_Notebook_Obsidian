*"All five of our ships were sunk. There are mysterious and hostile cultists looking to burn the world. The Leviathan is dead. What is happening to the state of Eilanaat?" -Theodoros Delphi*

- I was traveling from [[Portabora]] to the island of [[Amakaru]] to meet with the team who recruited me to participate in the [[Trial of Salt]]. A previous colleague of mine, [[Roland Dockson|Dockson]], seems to also be participating in this trial and has approached me on this boat.  
- I had a strange dream of a young girl who was glowing white on an isolated island with a small shack and small, broken boat. She reached out to me and said "Remember me"
	- Addendum - It seems like this figure is [[Alune]], who is said to be the Mother of the Leviathans. But what is her connection to me? What does she want me to remember?
- [[Sons of Fire]]Â were encountered on the island of Amakaru after they assaulted our fleet of ships. They were the people who took down our fleet of ships to kidnap the representative of the Church of Salt, [[Melissa Aligar]], who is needed to enter the Trial of Salt. 
	- Believes that the Church of Salt isn't enough to save Eilanaat and would rather restart the world
	- Proclaimed their beliefs that the Church of Salt isn't enough to save Eilanaat and would rather restart the world
- We found the [[The Phantom]] dead as we were trying to find a town to seek help and find our captain, . The leviathan seemed to have died to the [[The Blight|Blight]], which has been affecting all the Leviathans
	- There were a few [[Deepspeakers]] who were eating the corpse of the Leviathan and died shortly after. 
	- Groupmates seemed interested in taking parts of the dead leviathan
- We traversed through a mine on the way to the Town of Amakaru. There was a [[Lock]] in the mines
	- [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]] was pulled into the Lock by the mysterious forces from the other side of the door but was stopped before she could go through. She  claims she was mind controlled to get pulled into the Lock, but she also expressed interest to talk to the being behind the Lock. 
	- A mysterious eye looked at the group through a hole in the lock. Does psychic damage
	- We found a note mentioning [[Manor Lord Ardwin]] discussing how the deepspeakers wanted to seal the Lock
	- There was a crack in the lock
- Those who resided in the Town of Amakaru was found to be in a magically induced slumber. It seemed like they were asleep for a few days, and, if left in that state for a few more days, would die
	- It seemed to have been related to the crack in the Lock we had discovered
	- We found our captain, [[Sheera Arrendale]], at Lord Ardwin's manor asleep. Seeing we needed her to start our journey, we set out to a small, unnamed Archipelago to seek out an alchemist that could help 
	- The [[Lemuel Sanguine|Boy]] and his [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] looted a store while everyone was asleep
	- While resting in the town, a tardigrade-like monster attempted to control [[Avery Vale|Vale]] while invisible. When it died, it disintegrated, leaving only blue blood on the floor. It feels similar to the being in the mines. 
		- Does psychic damage and is resistant to psychic damage.
		- Seems to have an attack that targets intelligence and wisdom saving throws. Controls people with Charisma saving throws.
		- Running theory: Remanent of the Phantom or related to the being in the lock
