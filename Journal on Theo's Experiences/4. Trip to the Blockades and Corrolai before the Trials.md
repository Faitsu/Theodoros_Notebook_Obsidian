*"We have acquired the [[Melissa Aligar|cleric]] from the Sons of Flame, so our true test can begin. However, I have let myself go again to the curse that I possess and have almost put my colleagues in danger. I must keep an eye on my condition as we continue these trials; this incident confirms to me that I should keep my distance from these people..." - Theodoros Delphi*
** See [[4.1 Section Notes]] for all the non Theodoros content before we headed towards the blockades ** 

- On the way to [[Corrolai]] we stop briefly at the Blockades to restock on resources
	- The mercenaries guarding the island tried to upcharge crew 5x the normal amount for entry fee (20g to 100g), but they still respected my title as the Leviathan of Steel and waived the charge
	- They warned the rest of the crew of my actions, but nothing came out of it
- We all ended up going our separate ways for the night
	- [[Avery Vale|Vale]] and [[Melissa Aligar|Aligar]] go on a date
	- I took up some work to earn some pocket change and to try and gather information from the locals about recent happenings
	- The new [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] goes to buy supplies to sell
	- [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]]'s whereabouts were unknown
	- The [[Lemuel Sanguine|boy]] stayed on the ship
- On our way to [[Corrolai]], we ran into a "tapestry" dealer
	- He delt Golden Scratch, a substance created by combining golden salt and tobacco
		- Gives the users an advantage on ability checks and a disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. It will also exhaust the user after use. Seems highly addictive
		- Conjecture: Is Golden Salt connected to the Saint of Ambition? The effects of golden salt seem to give off the same give/take relationship that the Saint's Curse gives off. What exactly does the [[Church of Salt]] worship?
- I had a few talks with some of the crew
	- I had a brief talk with the [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] who agreed with my hesitance to trust [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]]
	- [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]] approached me to try and negotiate an alliance to find out more about [[Satiniel]], a being who calls himself the Saint of Ambition, since I mentioned I was looking for information about him
		- She entrusted me with her journal to read as a sign of good faith. 
			- A sign of faith that seems very choreographed. Personally, I keep many journals of my own, so I would not be surprised if she also had her own collection. She could be giving me a decoy to keep me placated. 
	- The [[Lemuel Sanguine|boy]] came up to me to talk about his disgust and suspicions of [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]], to which I validated his worry
		- I should not stoke the fire between teammates, however if the feelings of the crew all align with not wanting to work with a person, then it is good to collect this info so it can be actionable
	- During our time in [[Corrolai]], we went our separate ways once again
		- [[Avery Vale|Vale]] went on another date with [[Melissa Aligar|Aligar]]
		- [[Kyrie River Ford|Ford]] went to research at the library, which she shared with the group:
			- The [[Church of Salt]] was founded by the High Prophet in the last 50 years
			- He foretold of the Leviathans being plagued, and a golden comet would be sent down by the Herald to be Iridessa's salvation
			- The Prophet also received golden salt, which is said to have many miraculous properties
			- Not much information about [[Satiniel]]
		- The [[Vivienne the Coward|Captain]] went to visit the High Prophet
			- She met with [[Bishop Darius|Bishop]] Darius instead, who told her we would be getting a piece of land from the Church
				- Also taught us the greetings for the church
					- "May the Herald Guide you"
					- "Ann Una [Iridesca]()" -> farewell
		- I went to go talk to my old mentor to confront him about Lynn's condition 
			- I was met by Wallace's current right hand man, Jared Stenello
			- Wallace explained to me how [[Satiniel]] came to him to help "him and his family" in his time of need, but did not know that the deal extended to the rest of his family
				- He does not regret this. 
			- His solutions to alleviate the effects of [[Satiniel]] draining his ambition was originally to siphon other people's ambitions or to use golden salt
			- He mentions how he would support me in the shadows, but does not want to support us outright since he does not want to have more direct ties with the Leviathan of Steel
		- He gives me information he knows about [[Satiniel]]: 
			- He is known for tricking people, like in his deal with Wallace
			- Likes to be in places with people in dire need or ambition
			- Might be under some deal
			- He seems to serve an actual god known as Ambition. It is not the force itself, but more like an idea that is personified
		- He mentioned that my father is doing well back in [[Portobora]]. 
- We gathered the crew together to learn about the clue that will lead us to the place we needed to be for the first trial
	- "Swallowed by the Mouth of the Sea, the [[Vivienne the Coward|Mother]] of Pearl awaits those who seek Eilanaat's salvation. Retrieve this treasure of old among the memories of our forebears, and the next stage of the Trial will be open to you."
	- The [[Melissa Aligar|Cleric]] started to speak about [[Epigraphs|strange stories]] after reciting the clue. 
- I did some research in the new library we acquired from the [[Church of Salt]] to help figure out where we needed to go:
	- **Typical Whirlpool Areas:**
	    - The Father's Embrace
	    - The Screaming whirl
	    - **The Maw of Ouroboros**
	    - The coil
	-  **The Profound:**
		- Ruins can be found in the lower tail
        - Also found ruins in whirlpools near [[Corrolai]]
	    - Originally, celestials lived on Eilanaat, but they left some time ago, and their descendants were left.
